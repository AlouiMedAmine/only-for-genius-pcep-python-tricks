Q256: A function parameter is a kind of variable accessible:

Answer: only inside the function

---------------

Local variables in python are those variables
that are declared inside the function.

 Alternatively, they are said to defined
 within a local scope.

A user can only access a local variable inside
the function but never outside it.
