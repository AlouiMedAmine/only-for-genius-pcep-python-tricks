Q160:  What do you call a computer program which directly executes
instructions written in a programming language?

Answer:  An interpreter

--------------
A Python interpreter is a computer program that
takes the Python code and converts it into machine code.

We also have compilers that translate high-level
code into machine code before execution but
an interpreter is different.

It translates the code you write into instructions
that the computer can understand, executing them line by line.
