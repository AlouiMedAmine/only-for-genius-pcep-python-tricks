q148:  What do you call a tool that lets you
launch your code step-by-step
and inspect it at each moment of execution?


Answer: A debugger


--------------------------------
A debugger is a program that can help you find
out what is going on in a computer program.
You can stop the execution at any prescribed line number,
 print out variables, continue execution, 
stop again, execute statements one by one,
and repeat such actions until
you have tracked down abnormal behavior 
 and found bugs.
